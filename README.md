# food_recipe_cook_time_project

This is a cook_time_prediction project, the data are scraped from food.com, and the model is trained based on the data scraped. Features included in the model are like
'number of ingredients', 'length of recipe', 'date posted', etc. So that, given a recipe in specific format, we can predict how long the cook-time is gonna take.
