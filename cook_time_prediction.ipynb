       "  'description': 'i had always been a great follower of craig claiborne and pierre franey of the new york times, and learned to cook by following their recipes. they printed this recipe in 1987, from which i learned to make a rich, delicious stock and heartwarming soup. i have continued this tradition for 21 years now, and am posting this recipe here so that i am assured of never losing it! over the years, though, i have made some personalization to it. for instance, my habit has been, after dinner, to remove all meat from the turkey frame. i then immediately put the entire turkey frame in a huge stockpot with enough water to cover, and add the rest of the stock ingredients. instead of cooking it for 1 hour, though, i usually let it simmer for anywhere from 3 to 4 hours. before i go to bed for the evening, i strain the soup, let it cool, and refrigerate for use the next day. that thanksgiving friday, i skim the fat off the chilled stock, and then prepare the soup as directed. again, i must reiterate, it is delicious!',\n",
